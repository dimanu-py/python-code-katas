## Description

Here you find a simple order flow application. It's able to create orders, do some calculation (totals and taxes), and manage
them (approval/reject and shipment).

The old development team did not find the time to build a proper domain model but instead preferred to use a procedural style, building
this anemic domain model. Fortunately, they did at least take the time to write unit tests for the code.

Your new CTO, after many bugs caused by this application, asked you to refactor this code to make it more maintainable and reliable.

You should be able to remove all the setters moving the behavior into the domain objects.

But don't stop there. If you can remove some test cases because they don't make sense anymore (eg: you cannot compile the code to do the
wrong thing) feel free to do it!

## Objective

The main objective of the kata is to work with the tell don't ask principle.

We want to learn how to refactor legacy code, trying to apply automatic refactors and keeping tests green.
