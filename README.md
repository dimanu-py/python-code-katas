# :snake: Python Code Katas :snake:

> [!NOTE]
> All the code katas are solved using Python. Most of the katas are configured in a similar way, using uv as package manager and python 3.12.
> Those katas that need extra or different configurations will have its specific instructions in the README file.

## Standard Configuration

The project can be configured either by using `pip` or `pyenv`. Both ways will be explained.

<details><summary>Using pip</summary>

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate # Linux / Mac
    .venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
</details>

<details><summary>Using pyenv and uv</summary>

These instructions are extracted from pyenv documentation. You can find everything [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file)

1. Install pyenv:
    ```bash
    curl https://pyenv.run | bash
    ```
2. Set you bash profile to load pyenv. In my case I use fish:

    ```bash
    set -Ux PYENV_ROOT $HOME/.pyenv
    fish_add_path $PYENV_ROOT/bin
   
    echo pyenv init - | source >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
    ```
3. Select the python version you want to use:
    ```bash
    pyenv install 3.12
    pyenv local 3.12
    ```
   
4. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    uv sync --all-groups
    ```
</details>

## Running the tests

To run the tests, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
pytest
```

or

```bash
uv run pytest kata_name/tests
```

> [!NOTE]
> I tend to use a Makefile to store the most common commands. You can check the Makefile in the root of the project.
