## Description

Program the Tic Tac Toe game following a red -> green -> refactor loop. The rules are the following:

- Player X always goes first
- Same player cannot play twice in a row
- Players alternate placing their marks on the board
- Players cannot play on a played position
- A player with three of their marks in a row, column or diagonal wins
- If all 9 squares are filled and neither player achieves 3 in a row, the game is a draw

## Objective

The main objective is to practice:
- TDD
- SOLID
- Object calisthenics
