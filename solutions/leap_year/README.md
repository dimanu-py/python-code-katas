## Description
  
Write a function that:
- Receives an integer as input.
- Returns `True` if the input is a leap year
- Returns `False` if the input is not a leap year

A leap year must follow these rules:

- A year is not leap if it is not divisible by 4
- A year is leap if it is divisible by 4
- A year is leap if it is divisible by 400
- A year is not leap if it is divisible by 100 but not by 400

### Examples

- 1997 is not leap (not divisible by 4)
- 1996 is leap (divisible by 4)
- 1600 is leap (divisible by 400)
- 1800 is not leap (divisible by 4, divisible by 100, NOT divisible by 400)

## Objective

The main objective of this kata is to improve logic skills in Python.

Additionally, TDD is going to be used as methodology to develop the function. The following concepts will be applied:

- Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Fake it till you make it
- Baby steps
- Test parametrization
