## Description

Ohce is a console application that echoes the reverse of what you input through the console.

Even though it seems a silly application, ohce knows a thing or two.

1. When you start ohce, it greets you differently depending on the current time, but only in Spanish:
    - Between 20 and 6 hours, ohce will greet you saying: Â¡Buenas noches < your name >!
    - Between 6 and 12 hours, ohce will greet you saying: Â¡Buenos dÃ­as < your name >!
    - Between 12 and 20 hours, ohce will greet you saying: Â¡Buenas tardes < your name >!
2. When you introduce a palindrome, ohce likes it and after reverse-echoing it, it adds Â¡Bonita palabra!
3. Ohce knows when to stop, you just have to write Stop! and it'll answer Adios < your name > and end.

```bash
$ ohce Pedro
> Â¡Buenos dÃ­as Pedro!
$ hola
> aloh
$ oto
> oto
> Â¡Bonita palabra!
$ stop
> pots
$ Stop!
> Adios Pedro
```
